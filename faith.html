					<h2 class="major"><span>For those considering CCA who <em>are</em> Christians…</span></h2>

					<p>The classical, Christian foundation of a CCA education ensures that your child will receive rigorous instruction in the liberal arts and sciences and in classical virtue in a manner consistent with the principles of the Christian faith.  However, we believe that it remains the responsibility of parents and the church to catechize children and to disciple them in the faith. Thus, CCA will support you—but will not displace you—in the fulfillment of that duty.</p>

					<p>Moreover, while we are not neutral about the fundamental truth of Christianity, as a matter both of institutional competence and of doctrinal integrity, we believe that an ecumenical approach to such matters presents more challenges than benefits.</p>

                </section>

				<section class="box features" id="nonchristian">
					<h2 class="major"><span>For those considering CCA who <em>are not</em> Christians… </span></h2>

					<p>Any honest assessment of Western thought and culture must acknowledge the classical, Christian foundations at its base. In addition, a school that purports to be neutral with respect to those foundations is either mistaken or misleading about the matter. Either moral virtue is divinely ordained and fixed, or it is merely a human invention and changeable; either truth is objective and knowable, or it is subjective and a matter of individual perspective; either man and his world are part of a created order, or they are the product of material and chance. In each case, we believe the former is true, and not the latter.</p>

					<p>Nonetheless, the instruction that we provide at CCA is not proselytic in nature. We will not require your student to affirm any particular religious doctrine as part of their academic program or to participate in liturgical exercises as part of school life. Our commitment is to provide every child with an excellent education in knowledge and virtue, while at the same time respecting the role of parents as the first and final authority over their child’s training in ultimate matters.</p>
